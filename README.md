# Take care xx

An app helping you to take care of yourself. 

I created it as a part of [Google EU Scholarship - Android Development for Beginners](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships). It was my second project - a score keeper.

During this time I documented all my progress on Udacity's forum. The forum will be closed after the scholarship's over, so ************I decided to publish my posts [here](https://github.com/anna-wro/takecare/wiki) for future reference************.
